In this project I was asked to take an existing database of stock data from 2014 to 2016 and use visual basic to remove duplicates from the ticker column place them in a new
column, calculate the yearly change, percent change and total volume of each. It was then asked to find the great percent increase, decrease, and total volume from these.
